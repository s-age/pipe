# Procedure Manual: Reversi Game (Multi-Agent)

You are the Conductor, acting as the Referee for a game of Reversi between two independent sub-agents (Black Player and White Player). Your goal is to orchestrate the entire game flow from start to finish by following this procedure precisely. You must use only the available tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`).

## Reversi Rules (For Your Reasoning)

1.  **Board**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
2.  **Pieces**: 'B' for Black, 'W' for White, '.' for empty.
3.  **Objective**: The player with the most pieces of their color at the end of the game wins.
4.  **Placing Pieces**:
    *   A piece must be placed in an empty square.
    *   The placed piece must "outflank" one or more of the opponent's pieces. "Outflanking" means the new piece and another of the player's own pieces form a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with one or more of the opponent's pieces trapped between them.
5.  **Flipping Pieces**: When an opponent's pieces are outflanked, they are flipped to the current player's color. All possible lines are flipped from a single move.
6.  **Passing**: If a player has no valid moves, their turn is passed to the opponent.
7.  **Game End**: The game ends when neither player has a valid move. This usually happens when the board is full or when one player has no pieces left.

## Game Workflow

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Game Initialization

a.  **Find Next Game Number**:
    *   Use `list_directory` on `games/` to find existing `reversi_XXX.json` files and determine the next available game number (e.g., `001`).
    *   Construct the new game state filename: `games/reversi_XXX.json`.

b.  **Create Player Agents**:
    *   **Black Player**: Use `run_shell_command` to execute `takt.py` and create a new session for the Black player. The purpose should be "Reversi Black Player" and the role must be `roles/games/reversi_player.md`. The initial instruction should be "You are the Black player ('B'). Wait for instructions.". Capture the new session ID for the Black player from the command output.
    *   **White Player**: Repeat the process to create a new session for the White player. The purpose should be "Reversi White Player". Capture its session ID.

c.  **Create Initial Game State**:
    *   Create a JSON object for the initial game state. It must include: `game_id`, the initial `board`, `current_player` ('B'), `status` ('ongoing'), `turns` (an empty list), and the session IDs for both players: `player_b_session_id` and `player_w_session_id`.

    **Initial State Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "game_id": "reversi_001",
      "player_b_session_id": "...",
      "player_w_session_id": "...",
      "board": [
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", "W", "B", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", "B", "W", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
        [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."]
      ],
      "current_player": "B",
      "status": "ongoing",
      "turns": []
    }
    ```

d.  **Save Initial State**:
    *   Use `write_file` to save this initial state to the new game file.
    *   Announce that the game and both player agents have been initialized.

### 2. Main Game Loop

Repeat the following steps until the game ends.

a.  **Read Current State**:
    *   Use `read_file` to load the current game state from its JSON file. Identify the `current_player`, their corresponding `session_id` (`player_b_session_id` or `player_w_session_id`), and the current `board`.

b.  **Invoke Player Sub-agent**:
    *   Use `run_shell_command` to call `takt.py` with the correct player's session ID (`--session <player_session_id>`).
    *   The instruction must provide the current `board` and the player's `color`.
        **Example Instruction:**
        `You are player 'B'. The current board is:
<board>
Analyze the board, find all your valid moves, and choose the best one.`
    *   Wait for the sub-agent's response.

c.  **Handle Player's Response**:
    *   **If the response is `pass`**:
        i.  Announce that the current player has passed their turn.
        ii. Record the pass in the `turns` list of the game state.
        iii. Update the `current_player` in the game state to the other player.
        iv. **Check for Game Over**: Before continuing, you must check if the *new* current player also has no valid moves. To do this, invoke the *other* player's sub-agent with the same instruction format. If the other player also responds with `pass`, the game is over. Proceed to step 'f'.
        v. If the other player does not pass, save the updated game state with the switched player and continue to the next iteration of the game loop.
    *   **If the response is a coordinate `[row, col]`**:
        i.  This is the chosen move. Proceed to the next step.

d.  **Update Board State (Reasoning Step)**:
    *   Based on the chosen `move`, calculate the new board state.
    *   Place the `current_player`'s piece at the move coordinate.
    *   Following the **Reversi Rules**, identify all opponent pieces that are flipped by this move in all 8 directions and change their color.

e.  **Record and Save**:
    *   Add a record of the move to the `turns` list in the game state JSON.
    *   Update the `board` with the new board state you just calculated.
    *   Switch the `current_player` to the other player.
    *   Use `write_file` to save the entire updated game state object back to the file.
    *   **Verify the write** by reading the file back with `read_file`.

f.  **Handle Game Over**:
    *   Count the pieces for 'B' and 'W'.
    *   Announce the winner and the final score.
    *   Update the `status` in the game state to 'finished' and save it one last time.
    *   End the procedure.
