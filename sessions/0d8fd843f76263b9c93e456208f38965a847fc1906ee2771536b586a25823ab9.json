          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. It was officially launched on August 7, 2025, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface.\n\nSome of its notable features include:\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which helps in solving complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It employs a built-in routing system that decides whether to answer instantly or to engage in a step-by-step \"chain-of-thought\" process for more complex queries.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** The model is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content from these data types in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks testing mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements over previous models, including faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** It implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries, resulting in fewer rejections for users seeking harmless information.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. For API users, GPT-5 is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`. ChatGPT Plus and Pro users have access to `GPT-5 Thinking`, with `GPT-5 Pro` being exclusive to ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering real-time model routing and enhanced features without extra cost."
