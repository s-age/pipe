          "content": "GPT-5, OpenAI's latest-generation large language model, was officially released on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal AI model that builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advanced reasoning capabilities and unifying various functionalities under a common interface.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 can process and generate content from multiple data types simultaneously, including text, images, and audio, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning** The model directly incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It features a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning.\n*   **Improved Performance** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers, and reduced hallucination levels compared to its predecessors. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its tasks.\n*   **Context Handling** The model significantly expands its ability to understand and retain context, processing large documents, multi-hour meetings, and extensive codebases without losing details.\n*   **Accessibility** GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for both free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o entirely.\n*   **Variants** GPT-5 is not a single model but a system of models, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. For deeper reasoning, variants like `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-pro` are available.\n\nOpenAI also released search-enhanced models in October 2025, such as `gpt-5-search-api` and `gpt-5-search-api-2025-10-14`, which embed web search functionality directly into AI responses, allowing the AI to fetch real-time information and provide cited answers."
