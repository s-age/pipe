          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth generation of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that succeeds GPT-4, with GPT-4.5 (internally known as Orion) serving as a transitional model.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning capabilities with non-reasoning functionality under a single interface, aiming to eliminate the need for users to switch between specialized models. At its release, it demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n\nNotable improvements and features include:\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning:** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It features a real-time router that intelligently decides whether to provide an instant response or engage in a more deliberate, step-by-step \"thinking\" process for complex queries.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various data types simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. It also boasts video frame analysis and enhanced visual reasoning capabilities.\n*   **Context Handling:** GPT-5 significantly expands its context window, allowing it to retain and process more information. In ChatGPT, it can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, while through the API, this expands to 400,000 tokens.\n*   **Improved Performance:** Users can expect faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and reduced levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information relevant to its tasks.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** OpenAI has implemented a \"Safe Completions\" approach, where GPT-5 provides helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries. It also aims to give more critical and \"less effusively agreeable\" answers.\n*   **Coding and Writing:** Developers benefit from smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents. For writing, it offers improved style, depth, and greater control over tone.\n*   **Real-time Voice:** GPT-5 features a real-time voice mode with natural-sounding, customizable voice personalities.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking-nano`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. The free tier of ChatGPT offers GPT-5 with standard reasoning, while Plus and Pro subscribers receive increased usage limits and enhanced reasoning performance.\n\n**Training Process:**\nGPT-5's training involved three stages: unsupervised pretraining on a vast multilingual dataset, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Its visual and text capabilities were developed alongside each other during training.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\nIn October 2025, OpenAI released search-enhanced GPT-5 models, including `gpt-5-search-api-2025-10-14` and an evergreen `gpt-5-search-api`, which integrate web search functionality directly into AI responses, allowing the model to fetch real-time information and provide cited answers.\n\nWhile GPT-5 has been met with excitement, there have been some initial challenges, including elevated error rates and service disruptions during its launch week. An early claim by OpenAI researchers about GPT-5 solving previously unsolved mathematical problems was later clarified, indicating the model had surfaced existing research rather than independently proving new solutions. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also acknowledged the need to further refine GPT-5's personality to make the model \"feel warmer\" for users."
