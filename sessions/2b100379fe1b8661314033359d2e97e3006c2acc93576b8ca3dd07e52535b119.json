          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It succeeds GPT-4 and integrates advanced reasoning capabilities with multimodal input and task execution into a unified system.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to handle complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It features a built-in routing system that decides whether to provide an instant answer or engage in a step-by-step \"chain-of-thought\" process for more complex queries.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content from these data types in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks testing mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n*   **Context Handling** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task. It also offers native integrations for interacting directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites.\n*   **Safety** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is rolling out to all ChatGPT users, including free, Plus, and Pro tiers, with varying usage limits and access to advanced capabilities. Microsoft Copilot is now powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced features without extra cost or manual setup.\n\n**Variants:**\nThe GPT-5 system includes several variants: `gpt-5-main` (the flagship model), `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`. These variants are optimized for different use cases, balancing reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. Developers can access the thinking model and its mini and nano versions via the OpenAI API, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. ChatGPT provides access to `gpt-5-thinking` with a \"Pro\" setting for parallel test-time compute.\n\n**Background:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2025, and CEO Sam Altman confirmed the company was working on its development. Prior to its release, OpenAI rolled out GPT-4.5 (internally known as Orion) as a transitional model that improved reasoning accuracy and reduced hallucinations. The launch of GPT-5 was preceded by the release of GPT-OSS, a set of open-weight models with reasoning capabilities, on August 5, 2025."
