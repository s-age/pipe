          "summary": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth generation of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that unifies advanced reasoning capabilities with multimodal input and task execution within a single system.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, previously found in OpenAI's o-series models, and automatically routes queries between a fast, high-throughput model for routine tasks and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Enhanced Performance** The model demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, with dramatically reduced hallucination rates on factual tasks. It also offers faster response times compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Advanced Coding** GPT-5 provides smarter code generation, an expanded context window for managing larger projects, and improved debugging and code review. It can generate complete, deployable applications from natural language prompts, a feature referred to as \"Vibe Coding\".\n*   **Multimodal Processing** It natively handles various data types, including text, images, audio, and video, allowing for integrated understanding and content generation from these inputs.\n*   **Improved Writing** The model offers enhanced writing skills, providing better style and depth, and more control over the tone of content.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser to complete tasks.\n*   **\"Safe Completions\"** OpenAI has implemented a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful and high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright refusing them.\n*   **Context Window** GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens, with some advanced versions offering 128,000 tokens.\n\nGPT-5 is publicly available to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is now the default model for all ChatGPT users, both free and paid. The system comprises a family of models, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, with specialized variants optimized for different use cases and accessible through various ChatGPT tiers and the API."

          "summary": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It represents a significant advancement over its predecessors, including GPT-4 and GPT-4o, by unifying advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single, adaptive system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 operates as a unified system that automatically selects the most appropriate model for a given task, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models for speed or deeper reasoning. This is managed by a real-time router that assesses conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It can engage in a \"chain-of-thought\" process for intricate queries.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 can process and generate content from various data types simultaneously, including text, images, and voice. It also features video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers more accurate answers to questions, including those related to health, and significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to earlier models.\n*   **Advanced Coding and Writing** The model provides faster response times and improved skills in coding and writing, including smarter code generation and an expanded context window for managing larger projects.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Safety Features** It employs a \"Safe Completions\" approach, designed to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries.\n*   **Context Length** In the API, GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens.\n\n**Accessibility and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly available to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers via the OpenAI API. It is the default model for all ChatGPT users, both free and paid. The GPT-5 system comprises several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. ChatGPT Plus and Pro tiers offer increased usage limits and access to more advanced reasoning modes, such as `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-thinking-pro`.\n\n**Performance:**\nAt its release, GPT-5 achieved state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. Notably, it outperformed humans on the SimpleBench benchmark, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%. It also demonstrated strong results in math and scientific reasoning benchmarks."
