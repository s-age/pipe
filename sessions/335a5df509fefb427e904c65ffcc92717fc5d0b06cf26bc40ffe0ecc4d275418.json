          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is available to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n\nKey aspects of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Release and Availability** GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025, and began rolling out across ChatGPT, the API, and GitHub Models Playground on the same day. It is now the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5.\n*   **Architecture and Capabilities** GPT-5 is a multimodal model, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. The system features a real-time router that automatically decides whether to use a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries or a deeper reasoning model for complex tasks.\n*   **Performance Improvements** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination rates. It has shown significant gains in logical reasoning, multi-step problem-solving, and memory retention. On coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, GPT-5 scored 74.9%, and on Aider Polyglot for multi-language code editing, it reached 88%.\n*   **Developer Features** For developers, GPT-5 offers features like \"Vibe Coding\" for generating deployable applications from natural language prompts, improved debugging and code review, and enhanced API capabilities with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. The API supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens.\n*   **Safety and Context** GPT-5 introduces \"safe completions,\" aiming to provide nuanced and informative responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them, and outlining limitations clearly. It also dramatically expands context windows, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing track of details.\n*   **Variants** GPT-5 is not a single model but a family of systems, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. ChatGPT offers access to `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-thinking-pro` for deeper reasoning."
