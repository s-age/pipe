          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This fifth iteration in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series is designed to unify advanced reasoning capabilities with non-reasoning functionality under a single interface.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, previously found in OpenAI's \"o-series\" models (like o1 and o3), directly into its core architecture. It employs a real-time router that automatically switches between a fast, high-throughput model for simple queries and a more profound \"thinking\" model for complex tasks, eliminating the need for manual model selection.\n*   **Enhanced Performance** The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports faster response times, improved coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and significantly reduced hallucination rates compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Multimodality and Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 offers unified multimodality, capable of processing and generating content from text, code, and images simultaneously, and includes video frame analysis. It also features agentic capabilities, allowing it to autonomously set up its own desktop and search for information using a browser.\n*   **Developer-Focused Improvements** For developers, GPT-5 introduces \"Vibe Coding,\" enabling the generation of complete, deployable applications from natural language prompts. It also provides enhanced debugging and code review functionalities.\n*   **Safety and Context Window** OpenAI has implemented a \"safe completions\" approach in GPT-5, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries. The model supports an expanded context length of approximately 256,000 tokens in ChatGPT and up to 400,000 tokens through the API.\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible through OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and developers can access it via the OpenAI API. While available to all ChatGPT users, Plus subscribers receive higher usage limits, and Pro users gain unlimited access to GPT-5, including the high-reasoning \"GPT-5 Pro\" variant. The API offers several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-thinking`."
