          "content": "GPT-5, OpenAI's fifth-generation large language model, was officially released on August 7, 2025, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants. It is a multimodal model capable of analyzing text, images, and audio, and is designed to handle complex, multi-step workflows with enhanced reasoning capabilities.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified System and Reasoning Routing** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system that combines a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries with a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. A real-time router automatically selects the appropriate model based on the conversation's complexity and user intent, eliminating the need for manual model selection.\n*   **Multimodality** The model is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It offers integrated text, image, and voice understanding through a single interface, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks across mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Improvements over previous models include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly reduced hallucination levels.\n*   **Context Handling** GPT-5 dramatically expands its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing track of details.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Availability** GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. Various versions are available, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-thinking` (or `gpt-5-pro` for ChatGPT Pro subscribers), each optimized for different use cases and performance needs.\n*   **Safety** GPT-5 incorporates a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals."
