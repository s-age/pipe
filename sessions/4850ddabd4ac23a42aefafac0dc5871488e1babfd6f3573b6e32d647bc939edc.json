          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4. GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities that were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models. A real-time router automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning.\n*   **Multimodality** The model is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can process and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance** GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, and more accurate answers, with significantly reduced hallucinations compared to earlier versions. It has shown improved performance in multi-step logical inference, scoring highly on advanced math competitions.\n*   **Context Handling** The model boasts an expanded context window, capable of holding around 256,000 tokens in memory within ChatGPT, and up to 400,000 tokens through the API.\n*   **AI Agent Capabilities** GPT-5 moves beyond being just a chatbot, incorporating agentic functionality that allows it to interact directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites.\n*   **Safety and Refusals** OpenAI has implemented a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries. It is designed to be more critical and \"less effusively agreeable\" than previous models.\n\nGPT-5 is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and accessible via the API. It is also the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o entirely. ChatGPT Plus and Pro users have access to `GPT-5 Thinking`, with `GPT-5 Pro` being exclusive to Pro subscribers.\n\nThe release of GPT-5 has been met with a mix of excitement and criticism from the community, with some users appreciating its deeper reasoning and others expressing a sense of loss for certain aspects of GPT-4o. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged the need for customization options to cater to different user preferences."
