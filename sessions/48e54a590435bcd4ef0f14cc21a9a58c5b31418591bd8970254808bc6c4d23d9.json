          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors.\n\nSome of its notable advancements include:\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which helps in solving complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It features a real-time router that automatically decides whether to use a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries or a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning.\n*   **Multimodality:** It can process and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI states that GPT-5's responses are 45% less likely to contain factual errors than GPT-4o with web search enabled, and 80% less likely than OpenAI o3 in reasoning mode.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, improved debugging, and the ability to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts (referred to as \"Vibe Coding\"). It also provides better style and depth in writing, with more control over tone.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and explaining limitations clearly, rather than issuing hard refusals.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. For API users, GPT-5 is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with varying costs based on input and output tokens. ChatGPT Plus and Pro users get higher usage limits and access to more advanced variants like GPT-5 Pro."
