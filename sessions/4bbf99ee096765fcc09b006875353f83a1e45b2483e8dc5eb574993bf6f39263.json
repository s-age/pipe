          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in their series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants like GPT-4o.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified System and Reasoning Routing:** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system that combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. It features a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate model (a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries or a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning) based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, without relying on pre-trained language or vision models. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks testing mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements over its predecessors, including faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced levels of hallucination.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, the model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** The model incorporates a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing user prompts.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases:\n*   **gpt-5-main / gpt-5:** The flagship model designed for deep analysis and complex workflows.\n*   **gpt-5-main-mini / gpt-5-mini:** A faster, lower-cost option with solid reasoning capabilities for quick, well-defined tasks.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking / gpt-5-thinking-pro:** A deeper reasoning model accessible via the API and ChatGPT Plus/Pro tiers, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-mini / gpt-5-thinking-nano / gpt-5-nano:** Smaller and faster versions of the thinking model, optimized for real-time and embedded applications.\n\n**Development and Release:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2025. The model was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025, and rolled out to users starting the same day. Prior to its release, OpenAI had introduced GPT-4.5 (internally known as Orion) as a transitional model that improved reasoning accuracy and reduced hallucinations.\n\n**Notable Incident:**\nShortly after its release, OpenAI researchers made claims on social media that GPT-5 had solved several previously unsolved Erdős problems in mathematics. These claims were later retracted or amended after mathematicians, including Thomas Bloom and Demis Hassabis, clarified that GPT-5 had only found known solutions that were unfamiliar to the operator of erdosproblems.com, rather than independently solving new problems."
