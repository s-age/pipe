          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is publicly accessible through OpenAI's ChatGPT and API, as well as Microsoft Copilot.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, aiming to eliminate the need for users to switch between specialized models.\n\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It features a real-time router that decides whether to provide an instant answer or engage in a step-by-step \"chain-of-thought\" process for more complex queries.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and has enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities. GPT-5 Image, for example, combines advanced language understanding with state-of-the-art image generation.\n*   **Improved Performance:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers, and reduced hallucination compared to its predecessors. It has shown state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task. It also offers advanced coding capabilities for developers, including smarter code generation and an expanded context window.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API, which significantly improves its ability to understand and retain context over long interactions.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Variants and Availability:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases. These include:\n*   `gpt-5-main` and `gpt-5-main-mini` for fast, high-throughput tasks.\n*   `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano` for deeper reasoning.\n*   ChatGPT offers `gpt-5-thinking-pro` for high-reasoning tasks with parallel test-time compute.\n\nIt is available across various ChatGPT tiers, including free and paid plans, and is the default model in ChatGPT for all users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering real-time model routing and massive context windows without extra cost.\n\n**Background and Reception:**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously indicated that the company was not training GPT-5 in April 2023, prioritizing GPT-4 development. However, by November 2024, Altman confirmed work on GPT-5, and a trademark for \"GPT-5\" was filed in July 2025. The model was widely anticipated, with reports of enterprise customers finding it \"materially better\" than GPT-4.\n\nUpon its release, some users criticized the removal of legacy GPT models for non-Pro ChatGPT users, leading Altman to state that OpenAI would reintroduce an option to select GPT-4o for Plus users. There was also a notable incident where OpenAI researchers prematurely claimed GPT-5 had solved previously unsolved math problems, which was later retracted as the model had only found known results unfamiliar to the operator of the problem database."
