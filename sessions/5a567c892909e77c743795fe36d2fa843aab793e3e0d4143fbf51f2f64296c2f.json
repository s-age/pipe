          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, the fifth iteration in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a unified interface.\n\nKey aspects of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Release and Availability** GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025, and is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It became the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o.\n*   **Capabilities and Improvements** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI highlights improvements such as faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination levels compared to its predecessors. It is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously.\n*   **Architecture and Variants** GPT-5 is not a single model but a system that includes a fast, high-throughput model, a deeper reasoning model, and a real-time router that selects the appropriate model based on the conversation's type, complexity, and user intent. The system includes variants such as `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are available.\n*   **Advanced Features** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It also features agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser. The model offers an expanded context window, capable of holding around 256,000 tokens in memory for ChatGPT and up to 400,000 through the API. Enhanced safety measures include \"Safe Completions,\" which provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusals.\n*   **Developer Advantages** For developers, GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents.\nSearch agent stderr: /Users/s-age/.pyenv/versions/3.12.11/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:648: ArbitraryTypeWarning: <built-in function any> is not a Python type (it may be an instance of an object), Pydantic will allow any object with no validation since we cannot even enforce that the input is an instance of the given type. To get rid of this error wrap the type with `pydantic.SkipValidation`.\n  warnings.warn("
