          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth iteration in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities that were previously found in OpenAI's \"o-series\" models.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model features integrated reasoning, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It also incorporates a reasoning routing system that determines whether to provide an instant response or engage in a more in-depth, step-by-step thought process for complex queries.\n*   **Multimodal Capabilities** GPT-5 is a multimodal LLM capable of analyzing text, images, and audio information, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors. Early benchmarks show GPT-5 outperforming humans on SimpleBench, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%.\n*   **Context Handling** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Safety Features** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries. It offers more nuanced and informative responses that also outline any limitations to prompts.\n*   **Availability** GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. Microsoft Copilot, powered by GPT-5, automatically selects the best model for each task without requiring manual selection.\n\nWhile there was an incident where OpenAI researchers initially claimed GPT-5 had solved previously unsolved math problems, this was later clarified as the model finding known results that were unfamiliar to the operator of erdosproblems.com. Mathematicians noted that AI models like GPT-5 are currently most helpful for speeding up basic research tasks like literature review rather than independently solving complex mathematical problems."
