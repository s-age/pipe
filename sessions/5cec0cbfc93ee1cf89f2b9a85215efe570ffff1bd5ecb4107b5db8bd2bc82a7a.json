          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest-generation multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\nGPT-5 is designed as a unified system that combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. A key differentiator is its real-time router, which automatically selects the most suitable model for a given task, choosing between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n*   **Unified Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text, images, and audio simultaneously, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Advanced Reasoning:** It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, previously found in OpenAI's o-series models, to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 is significantly more accurate and 45% less likely to contain factual errors than GPT-4o with web search enabled, and 80% less likely than OpenAI o3.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** The model offers improved coding performance, including smarter code generation, and better writing skills with more control over tone and depth.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** GPT-5 dramatically increases its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** It includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for task-related sources.\n*   **\"Safe Completions\" Approach:** GPT-5 aims to provide safe, high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them, offering nuanced and informative responses that explain limitations.\n\n**Model Variants and Availability:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a family of specialized variants. These include `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For developers, the OpenAI API offers `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity.\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT (including free, Plus, and Pro tiers) and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. In ChatGPT, GPT-5 is now the default model for all users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot, powered by GPT-5, offers real-time model routing and massive context windows without extra cost."
