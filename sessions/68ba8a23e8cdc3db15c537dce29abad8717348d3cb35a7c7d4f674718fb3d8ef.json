          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5 on August 7, 2025, as its latest-generation large language model. It is a multimodal model that builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advancements from reasoning-first models like o1 and o3. GPT-5 is now the default model in ChatGPT for all users, replacing GPT-4o, and is also available in Microsoft Copilot.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It features a real-time routing system that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, adapting in real time.\n*   **Multimodal Capabilities** The model is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can process and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Enhanced Performance** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in mathematics, programming, and finance. Improvements over GPT-4 include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers, and significantly reduced hallucinations.\n*   **Context Handling** It dramatically expands context window capabilities, allowing it to hold around 256,000 tokens in memory within ChatGPT and up to 400,000 tokens through the API, enabling it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases.\n*   **AI Agent Functionality** GPT-5 expands into AI agent capabilities, with native integrations that allow it to interact directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites. It can set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser.\n*   **Variants and Accessibility** GPT-5 is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, optimized for different use cases and available through the OpenAI API. It is accessible across various ChatGPT tiers, including free and paid plans, with the Pro tier offering a high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant.\n*   **Safety Features** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described GPT-5 as a \"significant step along the path to AGI\" (artificial general intelligence). While early claims about GPT-5 solving previously unsolved math problems were later clarified as misinterpretations, the model has proven useful for accelerating basic research tasks like literature review."
