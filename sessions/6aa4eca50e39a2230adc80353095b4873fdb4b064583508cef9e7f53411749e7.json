          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 is designed as a unified system that integrates both reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. A significant advancement is its real-time router, which automatically determines whether to use a fast, high-throughput model for simple queries or a deeper reasoning model for more complex tasks.\n\nAt its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI highlights improvements over its predecessors, such as faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and reduced hallucination levels. The model also features agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser.\n\nGPT-5 is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on diverse modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike previous models that often relied on already-trained language or vision models. It can process and generate content from text, code, images, and even perform video frame analysis. The model also boasts an expanded context window, capable of holding approximately 256,000 tokens in ChatGPT and up to 400,000 tokens via the API, enabling it to handle larger documents and multi-hour conversations.\n\nFor developers, GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including \"Vibe Coding\" for generating complete, deployable applications from natural language prompts, and significant improvements in debugging and code review. It also introduces \"safe completions,\" providing helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries.\n\n**Accessibility and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot. It is also available to developers through the OpenAI API. While free for all ChatGPT users, Plus subscribers receive higher usage limits, and Pro users gain unlimited access to GPT-5 Pro, a high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant. Microsoft Copilot users can benefit from GPT-5 without additional cost.\n\nOpenAI offers several variants of GPT-5, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking-nano`, `gpt-5-pro`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and performance needs.\n\n**Reception:**\nThe release of GPT-5 has been met with a mixed reception. While many are excited about its deeper reasoning capabilities, some users have expressed a preference for the personality of its predecessor, GPT-4o. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged this feedback, stating that the company is working on ways for users to customize the model and make it \"feel warmer\". There was also a notable incident where OpenAI researchers prematurely claimed GPT-5 had solved previously unsolved mathematical problems, a claim that was later retracted."
