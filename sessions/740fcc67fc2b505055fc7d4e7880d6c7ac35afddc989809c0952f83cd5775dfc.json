          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This fifth iteration in the GPT series builds upon its predecessors, integrating advanced reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a unified interface.\n\nGPT-5 is designed to handle complex, multi-step workflows and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Key improvements over previous models include faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and significantly reduced levels of hallucination.\n\nA notable architectural feature of GPT-5 is its unified adaptive system, which incorporates a real-time router. This system automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for more complex reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models. GPT-5 also introduces agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information relevant to its tasks.\n\nThe model boasts a massive context window, capable of holding around 256,000 tokens in memory for ChatGPT users, and expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This enables it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and is also available to developers through the OpenAI API. For developers, GPT-5 is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity."
