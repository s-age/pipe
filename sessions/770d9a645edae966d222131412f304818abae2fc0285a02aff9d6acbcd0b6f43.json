          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth iteration in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content from these data types in a single interaction.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** The model directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, building on advancements from OpenAI's \"o-series\" models. It can engage in a chain-of-thought process for complex queries, mapping out intermediate steps before providing a final answer.\n*   **Reasoning Routing System:** GPT-5 features a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate model for a given task, balancing speed and complexity. This means simple questions receive fast responses, while complex tasks get deeper, more thoughtful analysis.\n*   **Improved Performance:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced levels of hallucination compared to previous models.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** The model significantly increases its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing large documents, multi-hour meetings, and extensive codebases.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** It implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. In ChatGPT, it became the default model for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. For API users, it is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with varying pricing based on input and output tokens. Microsoft Copilot now utilizes GPT-5, offering enhanced features without additional cost.\n\n**Background and Development:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2023. While there were earlier reports and speculation about its release, including a transitional model known internally as Orion (released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025), GPT-5 was officially unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, had previously indicated that the company was working on GPT-5, and even compared its development to the Manhattan Project, highlighting its potential and risks.\n\n**Controversy:**\nFollowing its release, OpenAI researchers made claims on X (formerly Twitter) that GPT-5 had solved several previously unsolved Erdős problems in mathematics. However, these claims were later retracted or amended after mathematicians, including Thomas Bloom and Deepmind CEO Demis Hassabis, criticized them as misleading. It was clarified that GPT-5 had found known solutions that were unfamiliar to the operator of erdosproblems.com, rather than independently solving new problems.",
