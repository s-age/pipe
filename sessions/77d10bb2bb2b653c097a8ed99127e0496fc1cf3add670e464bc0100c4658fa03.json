          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is publicly accessible through OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and the OpenAI API.\n\nKey features and advancements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on various modalities such as text, images, and audio simultaneously. This allows it to process and generate content from these different data types within a single interaction.\n*   **Advanced Reasoning** The model integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, combining both reasoning and non-reasoning functionalities under a unified interface. It features a real-time routing system that intelligently decides whether to provide an instant response or engage in a multi-step \"chain-of-thought\" process for more complex queries.\n*   **Enhanced Performance** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, superior coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and reduced levels of hallucination.\n*   **Expanded Context Window** The model significantly expands its ability to understand and retain context. In ChatGPT, it can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, which extends to 400,000 tokens through the API. This enables it to process extensive documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing detail.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 incorporates agentic capabilities, allowing it to autonomously set up its own desktop environment and use a browser to search for information relevant to its tasks.\n*   **Model Variants** OpenAI offers GPT-5 in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`. ChatGPT users have access to `gpt-5-thinking`, with a \"pro\" setting available for enhanced performance.\n*   **Training Process** Its training involved three stages: unsupervised pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, utilizing a vast multilingual dataset of books, articles, web pages, academic papers, and licensed sources.\n\nGPT-5 is now the default model for all ChatGPT users, both free and paid, replacing GPT-4o. It is also integrated into Microsoft Copilot, offering smarter, safer, and more personalized AI experiences without additional cost or manual setup.\nSearch agent stderr: /Users/s-age/.pyenv/versions/3.12.11/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:648: ArbitraryTypeWarning: <built-in function any> is not a Python type (it may be an instance of an object), Pydantic will allow any object with no validation since we cannot even enforce that the input is an instance of the given type.
