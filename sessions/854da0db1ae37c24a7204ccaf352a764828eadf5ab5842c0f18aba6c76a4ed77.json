          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and integrates advanced reasoning capabilities previously seen in OpenAI's o-series models.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n\n*   **Unified Architecture and Multimodality:** GPT-5 was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can process and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities. It also offers natural-sounding, customizable voice personalities.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning and Routing:** The model features a real-time router that automatically selects the best model for a given task, choosing between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements in faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination levels compared to previous models. It has also shown to outperform humans on the SimpleBench reasoning questions, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** GPT-5 significantly increases its ability to understand and retain context, with the capacity to hold around 256,000 tokens in memory in ChatGPT, and up to 400,000 tokens through the API. Some rumors suggested it could support up to 1 million input tokens and 100,000 output tokens.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** OpenAI has implemented a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries. This results in fewer rejections for harmless information while still refusing unsafe questions.\n*   **Developer Advantages:** For developers, GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available across multiple ChatGPT tiers, including a free tier with standard reasoning capabilities and daily usage limits, a Plus tier with increased limits and improved reasoning, and a Pro tier with access to the high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant.\n\nThe GPT-5 system comprises several variants: `gpt-5-main` and `gpt-5-main-mini` for fast, high-throughput tasks, and `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-thinking-mini` for deeper reasoning. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are offered, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity for the API version.\n\n**Background and Reception:**\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously stated in April 2023 that the company was not training GPT-5 at that time, prioritizing GPT-4 development. However, OpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in July 2023, and Altman confirmed in November 2023 that the company was working on its development.\n\nUpon its release, some users criticized the removal of legacy GPT models for non-Pro ChatGPT users, as they preferred different models for distinct purposes. Altman acknowledged this feedback and stated that OpenAI would bring back an option to select GPT-4o for Plus users and would consider how long to offer legacy models. He also mentioned that OpenAI was working on GPT-5's personality to make the model \"feel warmer,\" with a corresponding update rolled out in August 2025."
