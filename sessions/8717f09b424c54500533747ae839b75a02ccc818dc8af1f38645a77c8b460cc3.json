          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 introduces a unified architecture that combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a single interface, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models. A real-time router automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n\nThe model boasts enhanced multimodality, capable of understanding and generating content from text, images, audio, and code natively and fluidly. It also includes video frame analysis capabilities and improved visual reasoning. OpenAI states that GPT-5 delivers state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, offering improved accuracy and significantly reduced hallucinations compared to its predecessors.\n\nIn terms of specific skills, GPT-5 offers better coding and writing abilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for managing larger projects, and improved debugging and code review. A feature dubbed \"Vibe Coding\" allows it to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts. The model also implements an advanced \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries. Furthermore, GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible through OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as via the OpenAI API for developers. It is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. Different tiers of ChatGPT (Free, Plus, Pro) offer varying usage limits and access to advanced features, including a \"thinking\" variant for complex reasoning tasks. The API supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens, with some versions offering up to 128,000 tokens.\n\n**Development Background:**\nWhile OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had indicated in April 2023 that GPT-5 was not actively being trained, focusing instead on GPT-4 development, the company later confirmed its work on the next iteration. An earlier internal project, code-named \"Orion,\" intended to be GPT-5, was eventually released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025 after it did not meet the expectations for GPT-5. Despite initial speculation about potential delays, GPT-5 was ultimately unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025."
