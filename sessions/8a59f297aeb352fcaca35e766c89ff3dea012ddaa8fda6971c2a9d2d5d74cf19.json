          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. It was officially launched on August 7, 2025, following its predecessor, GPT-4. OpenAI unveiled GPT-5 during a livestream event, making it publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface.\n\nNotable improvements and features include:\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which helps in solving complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It features a built-in routing system that decides whether to answer instantly or to \"think in steps\" for more complex queries.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike GPT-4. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content from these data types in a single interaction.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and lower levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task. It also offers native integrations for interacting directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than hard refusals.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is available across multiple ChatGPT tiers, including free and paid plans, and is the default model for all users, replacing GPT-4o. For API users, GPT-5 is offered in several variants: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. These variants are optimized for different use cases, balancing knowledge cut-off, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering real-time model routing and an enhanced user experience without extra cost.\n\n**Reception:**\nThe release of GPT-5 was met with a mix of excitement and criticism. Some users expressed frustration over the removal of legacy GPT models within ChatGPT for non-Pro users, as they preferred different models for distinct purposes and felt the GPT-5 router system offered less control. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged this feedback, stating that an option to select GPT-4o would be brought back for Plus users and that OpenAI is investing in steerability research to allow for customization."
