          "content": "GPT-5, OpenAI's fifth-generation generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation model, was officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that builds upon its predecessor, GPT-4, by integrating advanced reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a unified interface.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, and can analyze text, images, and audio, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Advanced Reasoning:** The model incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. It features a real-time router that dynamically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for more complex reasoning tasks.\n*   **Improved Performance:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to previous models.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its tasks.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, the model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API.\n*   **Unified System:** GPT-5 is not a single model but a system comprising various specialized variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-thinking`, and `gpt-5-thinking-pro`, which are optimized for different use cases and automatically chosen by a smart router based on task complexity.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT (including free and paid tiers) and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. For API users, different variants are offered with varying pricing based on input and output tokens.\n\n**Development Background:**\nWhile OpenAI CEO Sam Altman initially stated in April 2023 that GPT-5 was not in training, the company later filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in July 2023, and Altman confirmed its development in November 2023. An earlier internal model, \"Orion,\" intended to be GPT-5, was released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025 after failing to produce a sufficiently superior model. Leading up to its release, OpenAI also launched GPT-OSS, a set of open-weight models with reasoning capabilities."
