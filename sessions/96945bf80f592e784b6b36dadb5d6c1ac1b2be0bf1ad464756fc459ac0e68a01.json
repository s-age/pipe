          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This fifth iteration in the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series builds upon its predecessors, such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o, by integrating advanced reasoning capabilities and multimodal input into a unified system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 is designed to handle complex, multi-step workflows and offers significant improvements across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n\n*   **Unified Multimodality:** Unlike previous models that sometimes required switching between specialized versions, GPT-5 natively processes and generates content from text, images, and audio within a single interface. It can even analyze video frames and generate full web applications from simple prompts.\n*   **Advanced Reasoning:** The model incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to adapt in real-time and engage in a \"chain-of-thought\" process for complex queries. This helps in sustained problem-solving, such as multi-stage code debugging and layered business analysis.\n*   **Real-time Model Routing:** GPT-5 features an intelligent routing system that automatically selects the most appropriate model variant for a given task, balancing speed and complexity. This means simple questions receive fast responses, while complex ones get a deeper analysis.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers more accurate answers, better coding and writing skills, and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to earlier versions.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** The model boasts a massive context window, capable of holding around 256,000 tokens in ChatGPT and expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing track of details.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** Developers benefit from smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and improved debugging and code review. For writing, it offers better style, depth, and control over tone.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot product ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. Developers can also access it through the OpenAI API. The GPT-5 system is not a single model but a family of specialized variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. For API users, there are also options like `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-thinking-nano` with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity.\n\n**Training:**\nGPT-5 was trained from scratch as a natively multimodal model, meaning it learned from multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, rather than relying on pre-trained language or vision models. Its training involved unsupervised pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, using a large-scale multilingual dataset.\n\n**Reception and Development:**\nThe release of GPT-5 was highly anticipated, with OpenAI filing for a trademark in July 2025 and CEO Sam Altman confirming its development in November 2024. While an earlier internal model, \"Orion,\" intended to be GPT-5, was released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025, the official GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event. Initial reception has been mixed, with excitement over its capabilities but also some criticism, including a notable incident where OpenAI researchers prematurely claimed GPT-5 had solved previously unsolved math problems, which was later clarified as a misunderstanding.\nSearch agent stderr: /Users/s-age/.pyenv/versions/3.12.11/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:648: ArbitraryTypeWarning: <built-in function any> is not a Python type (it may be an instance of an object), Pydantic will allow any object with no validation since we cannot even enforce that the input is an instance of the given type.
