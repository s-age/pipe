          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This new model builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advancements from previous reasoning-first models like o1 and o3. GPT-5 is now the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. It is also accessible to developers through the OpenAI API and is included with Microsoft Copilot.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It employs a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. This integrated reasoning helps solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 can handle multiple data types simultaneously, processing and generating content from text, code, and images in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Accuracy** The model significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions and provides more accurate answers, especially in factual tasks.\n*   **Enhanced Coding Performance** OpenAI describes GPT-5 as its \"strongest coding model to date,\" demonstrating superior performance in code generation, debugging, and code review. It has set new state-of-the-art benchmarks on tests like SWE-bench Verified and Aider Polyglot. Developers can also use \"Vibe Coding\" to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n*   **Improved Writing Skills** GPT-5 offers better style and depth of writing, providing more control over the tone of content.\n*   **Advanced Safety** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries.\n*   **Context Window** GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400K tokens in the API, with some tiers offering up to 128K tokens.\n*   **Variants** GPT-5 is not a single model but a system of models. Variants include `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are offered, priced per million input and output tokens. ChatGPT Pro users have access to `GPT-5 Pro`, a high-reasoning variant with extended context windows and faster routing.\n\nThe development of GPT-5 involved extensive \"red team\" testing to identify and mitigate dangerous behaviors or biases before its release."
