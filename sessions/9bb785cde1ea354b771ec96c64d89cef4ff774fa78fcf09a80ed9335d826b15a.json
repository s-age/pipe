          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This release marks the fifth iteration in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning:** GPT-5 integrates advanced reasoning capabilities, combining the strengths of previous \"o-series\" models with the GPT series. It features a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, eliminating the need for manual switching.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model offers integrated text, image, and voice understanding through a single interface, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance:**\n    *   **Accuracy and Hallucination Reduction:** GPT-5 significantly reduces hallucinations and provides more accurate answers, particularly in factual and health-related tasks.\n    *   **Coding Skills:** It demonstrates substantial improvements in coding performance, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and better debugging and code review. It can even generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n    *   **Writing Skills:** The model offers enhanced writing with better style and depth, providing more control over content tone.\n    *   **Math and Scientific Reasoning:** GPT-5 shows strong results in math-heavy benchmarks and PhD-level science questions.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its tasks.\n*   **Safety:** OpenAI has implemented a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries.\n*   **Context Length:** In the API, GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400K tokens.\n\n**Availability:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available across multiple ChatGPT tiers, including a free tier with standard reasoning capabilities and daily usage limits, a Plus tier with increased limits and improved reasoning, and a Pro tier with unlimited access to the high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant.\n\n**Variants:**\n\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system that includes several variants optimized for different use cases: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are offered. The API version also has adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity."
