        "message": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is publicly accessible through ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and the OpenAI API.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, previously found in its o-series models, to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. The model employs real-time routing to automatically select the best model for a given task, balancing speed and complexity.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model that can handle various data types simultaneously, processing and generating content from text, code, and images in a single interaction. It also includes video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Enhanced Performance** Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, and more accurate answers to health questions. It demonstrates superior coding performance, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks on tests like SWE-bench Verified and Aider Polyglot. GPT-5 also shows strong results in math and scientific reasoning benchmarks.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Safety** The model significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions and was trained with a new \"safe completions\" method. This approach aims to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries, resulting in fewer rejections for harmless information.\n*   **Longer Context Windows** GPT-5 dramatically expands its ability to understand and retain context, supporting a combined input and output context length of 400K tokens in the API, with some tiers offering up to 128K tokens.\n*   **Developer-Focused Features** For developers, GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents. It can generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts, and shows major improvements in debugging and code review.\n\nGPT-5 is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, optimized for different use cases. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o entirely. Free ChatGPT users get standard reasoning capabilities with daily usage limits, while Plus and Pro tiers offer increased limits and access to more advanced \"thinking\" variants like GPT-5 Pro. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced AI experiences without extra cost or manual setup."
