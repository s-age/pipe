          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. It was officially launched on August 7, 2025, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 is designed as a unified system that combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. It features a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate model (a fast, high-throughput model for simple queries or a deeper reasoning model for complex tasks) based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n\nAt its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI highlights several improvements over its predecessors, such as faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly reduced levels of hallucination. The model also includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using its browser. It offers expanded context windows, capable of processing entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing track of details.\n\nGPT-5 also implements a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries, and offering more critical, \"less effusively agreeable\" answers.\n\n**Variants:**\nThe GPT-5 system comprises several variants optimized for different use cases. These include:\n*   **gpt-5:** The flagship model, designed for deep analysis and complex workflows.\n*   **gpt-5-main** and **gpt-5-main-mini:** Fast, high-throughput models.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking** and **gpt-5-thinking-mini:** Deeper reasoning models.\n*   **gpt-5-nano:** An ultra-fast, ultra-low-latency model for real-time applications.\n*   **gpt-5-chat:** A multimodal, memory-aware model built for enterprises.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-pro:** A version accessible via ChatGPT with parallel test-time compute for high-reasoning tasks.\n\n**Accessibility:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot product, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n*   **ChatGPT:** GPT-5 is the default model for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. Free users have standard reasoning capabilities and daily usage limits, while Plus subscribers receive increased usage limits and improved reasoning performance. Pro users gain unlimited access to GPT-5 and limited access to GPT-5 Pro, the high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant.\n*   **Microsoft Copilot:** GPT-5 is integrated into Microsoft Copilot, offering smarter, safer, and more personalized AI experiences without extra cost or manual setup.\n*   **OpenAI API:** Developers can access various GPT-5 models, including gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity.\n\n**Reception:**\nThe release of GPT-5 has been met with mixed reactions. While its advanced performance in complex reasoning, problem-solving, and coding is undeniable, some users have reported that it feels less creative or \"human\" compared to earlier models. There was also a notable incident where OpenAI researchers made a claim about GPT-5 solving previously unsolved mathematical problems, which was later retracted as a \"dramatic misinterpretation\"."
