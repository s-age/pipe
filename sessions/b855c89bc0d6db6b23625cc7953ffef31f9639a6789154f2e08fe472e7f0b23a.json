          "summary": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It serves as the successor to GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o and GPT-4.5 (Orion), and integrates advancements from earlier reasoning-focused models like o1 and o3.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 is designed to unify advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models.\n\n*   **Multimodality:** It can process and generate content from text, images, audio, and video frames, offering integrated understanding through a single interface.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. A real-time router automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for more complex reasoning.\n*   **Improved Performance:** OpenAI reports faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly reduced levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** The model includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser to complete tasks.\n*   **\"Safe Completions\":** GPT-5 employs a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful and high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them.\n*   **Benchmarks:** At its release, GPT-5 achieved state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics (AIME 2025, HMMT, FrontierMath), programming (SWE-bench Verified, Aider Polyglot), and multimodal understanding (MMMU, VideoMMMU, CharXiv Reasoning, ERQA). It has also been noted as the first model to outperform humans on SimpleBench.\n*   **Context Window:** The API version of GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of up to 400,000 tokens, while ChatGPT Pro users have access to a 128,000-token context window.\n*   **Developer Features:** It introduces \"Vibe Coding,\" allowing developers to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts, and offers improved debugging and code review capabilities.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible through OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as via the OpenAI API for developers. Different tiers of ChatGPT (Free, Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise) offer varying usage limits and access to specific GPT-5 variants.\n\n**Variants:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases. These include GPT-5 (the flagship model), GPT-5-mini (faster, lower-cost), GPT-5-nano (ultra-fast for real-time applications), and GPT-5-chat. Internally, it also utilizes models like gpt-5-main, gpt-5-main-mini, gpt-5-thinking, gpt-5-thinking-mini, and gpt-5-thinking-nano."
