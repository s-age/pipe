          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. It was officially launched on August 7, 2025, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface.\n\nSome of its key features include:\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which helps in solving complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It can engage in a chain-of-thought process for complex queries, mapping out intermediate steps before providing a final answer.\n*   **Real-time Model Routing:** The system includes a real-time router that automatically decides which model to use based on the conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit user intent. This allows for fast, succinct responses to simple queries and deeper, more thoughtful answers for complex tasks.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and has enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements in faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and lower levels of hallucination compared to previous models.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than blunt refusals.\n\n**Variants and Accessibility:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases. These include:\n*   `gpt-5` (the flagship model)\n*   `gpt-5-mini` and `gpt-5-nano` (faster, lower-cost options for quicker tasks)\n*   `gpt-5-thinking` (for deeper reasoning)\n*   `gpt-5-thinking-pro` (a high-reasoning variant with extended context windows and faster routing, accessible via ChatGPT Pro Tier)\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It became the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users upon its release.\n\n**Initial Reception:**\nWhile GPT-5 has been praised for its advancements, some users criticized the removal of legacy GPT models from ChatGPT for non-Pro users, which limited their control over model selection. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged this feedback and stated that an option to select GPT-4o would be brought back for Plus users. There was also a notable incident where OpenAI researchers made claims about GPT-5 solving previously unsolved math problems, which were later walked back as a \"dramatic misinterpretation\"."
