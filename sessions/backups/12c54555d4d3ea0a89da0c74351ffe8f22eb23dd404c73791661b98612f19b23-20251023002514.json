          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It represents the fifth generation in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 is designed as a unified adaptive system rather than a single model, incorporating a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" or \"reasoning\" model for more complex tasks. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n\nSignificant advancements and features of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Reasoning and Multimodality** It integrates advanced reasoning capabilities, previously seen in OpenAI's o-series models, with multimodal input processing, allowing it to handle text, code, images, and voice/audio, along with video frame analysis, within a single interface.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, enabling it to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It can engage in a chain-of-thought process for intricate queries.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations** GPT-5 significantly reduces hallucinations and provides more accurate answers, particularly for factual tasks. OpenAI states that its responses are 45% less likely to contain factual errors compared to GPT-4o with web search enabled.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance** It offers major improvements in coding, including smarter code generation, better debugging, and enhanced code review. It also introduces \"Vibe Coding,\" which allows it to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n*   **Enhanced Writing Skills** GPT-5 provides better writing capabilities and offers more control over the tone of content.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using its browser.\n*   **Longer Context Window** For API users, GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens, with the Pro tier offering a 128,000-token context window.\n*   **Advanced Safety** GPT-5 employs a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries. It is also trained to deliver more critical and less effusively agreeable answers.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and it is also available to developers through the OpenAI API. It has become the default model in ChatGPT for all users, replacing GPT-4o. While free ChatGPT users have access to GPT-5 with standard reasoning capabilities and daily usage limits, Plus users receive increased usage limits and improved reasoning performance. Pro subscribers gain unlimited access to GPT-5 and limited access to GPT-5 Pro, which is the high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant."
