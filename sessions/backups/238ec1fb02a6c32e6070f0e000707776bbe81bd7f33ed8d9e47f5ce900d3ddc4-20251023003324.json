          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This fifth iteration in the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution within a single system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n\n*   **Unified Architecture with Real-time Routing** GPT-5 operates as a dynamic system rather than a single model. It incorporates a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for straightforward queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for more complex tasks, eliminating the need for manual switching.\n*   **Multimodal Processing** The model can simultaneously process and generate content from various data types, including text, code, and images. It also features enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** GPT-5 demonstrates significant improvements in multi-step logical inference and problem-solving, integrating advanced reasoning capabilities previously found in OpenAI's specialized \"o-series\" models.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance** OpenAI highlights GPT-5 as its most capable coding model to date, offering better code generation, debugging, and code review. It achieves higher accuracy with greater efficiency, using fewer tokens and tool calls.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Accuracy** The model significantly reduces hallucination rates on factual tasks. OpenAI reports that GPT-5's responses are 45% less likely to contain factual errors compared to GPT-4o with web search enabled.\n*   **Enhanced Writing Skills** GPT-5 offers improvements in writing style and depth, providing users with more control over the tone of the generated content.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using its browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Extended Context Window** For API users, GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens. Within ChatGPT, it can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, with the Pro tier offering a 128,000-token context window.\n*   **\"Safe Completions\" Approach** GPT-5 employs a \"safe completions\" method, aiming to provide helpful and high-level responses to potentially harmful queries within safety boundaries, rather than outright refusing them.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible through OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as via the OpenAI API for developers. It is now the default model for all ChatGPT users, both free and paid.\n\nOpenAI offers GPT-5 as a family of models, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, specific variants like `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano` are available. ChatGPT users can access `gpt-5-thinking`, with Pro subscribers also having access to `gpt-5-thinking-pro`."
