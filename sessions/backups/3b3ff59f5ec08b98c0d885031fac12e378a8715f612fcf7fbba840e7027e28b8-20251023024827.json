          "content": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need for users to switch between specialized models. It combines reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface.\n\nSome of its notable capabilities and improvements include:\n*   **Enhanced Performance** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. It offers faster response times, improved coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and reduced hallucination levels compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning and Routing** The model features integrated deeper reasoning capabilities, which were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models. A real-time routing system automatically determines whether to provide an instant answer or engage in a multi-step \"chain-of-thought\" process for complex queries, balancing speed and analytical depth.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and includes video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model incorporates agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Expanded Context Window** GPT-5 significantly increases its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing large documents, multi-hour meetings, and extensive codebases without losing details. In ChatGPT, it can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API.\n*   **Advanced Safety** It implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products, ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and is also available to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o.\n\nThe GPT-5 system comprises several variants optimized for different use cases:\n*   **gpt-5-main** and **gpt-5-main-mini**: Fast, high-throughput models.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking**, **gpt-5-thinking-mini**, and **gpt-5-thinking-nano**: Deeper reasoning models, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity for API users.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-pro**: A version accessible via ChatGPT for Plus users, utilizing parallel test-time compute.\n*   Other variants include **gpt-5**, **gpt-5-mini**, **gpt-5-nano**, and **gpt-5-chat**.\n\n**Reception:**\nUpon its release, GPT-5 was met with a mix of excitement and criticism. Some users expressed frustration over the removal of legacy GPT models for non-Pro ChatGPT users, leading OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to state that an option to select GPT-4o would be brought back for Plus users. There was also a notable incident where OpenAI researchers made misleading claims about GPT-5 solving previously unsolved mathematical problems, which were later retracted.\nSearch agent stderr: /Users/s-age/.pyenv/versions/3.12.11/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:648: ArbitraryTypeWarning: <built-in function any> is not a Python type (it may be an instance of an object), Pydantic will allow any object with no validation since we cannot even enforce that the input is an instance of the given type.
