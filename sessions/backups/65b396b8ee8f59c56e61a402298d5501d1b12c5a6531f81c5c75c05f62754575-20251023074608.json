          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It represents a significant advancement over its predecessors, unifying advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution within a single system.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 integrates reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models. It employs a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate model based on the complexity and type of the user's query.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model directly incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy and nuance.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 can process and generate content from various data types simultaneously, including text, images, voice, and even video frame analysis.\n*   **Improved Coding Performance** It offers smarter code generation, an expanded context window for managing larger projects, and enhanced debugging and code review capabilities. A notable feature, \"Vibe Coding,\" allows it to generate complete, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Increased Accuracy** OpenAI states that GPT-5 significantly reduces factual errors and hallucination rates compared to previous models.\n*   **Faster Response Times** The model delivers noticeably faster response times and improved efficiency.\n*   **Enhanced Writing Skills** GPT-5 provides better style and depth in writing, offering users more control over the tone of the content.\n*   **Advanced Safety (\"Safe Completions\")** Instead of outright refusing potentially harmful queries, GPT-5 aims to provide safe, high-level responses that offer nuanced information and outline any limitations.\n*   **Massive Context Windows** It supports a combined input and output context length of up to 400,000 tokens for API users and 128,000 tokens for Pro/Enterprise users, enabling it to process extensive documents, long meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search the web for information relevant to its tasks.\n\nGPT-5 is accessible to the public through OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. It is also available to developers via the OpenAI API. While free for all ChatGPT users, Plus users receive higher usage limits, and Pro users gain unlimited access to GPT-5, including the high-reasoning \"thinking\" variant. Microsoft Copilot now integrates GPT-5 without additional cost or manual setup.\n\nThe GPT-5 system comprises various models, including `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`, optimized for different use cases and performance needs. For API users, pricing is based on input and output tokens."
