          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its fifth-generation multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and is designed to offer significant advancements in reasoning, multimodality, and agent-style task execution.\n\nKey aspects of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Release and Availability** GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event and became publicly accessible on August 7, 2025. It is available to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. For ChatGPT users, GPT-5 is the default model for all free and paid tiers, replacing GPT-4o entirely. Microsoft Copilot now also integrates GPT-5, offering enhanced AI experiences without extra cost or manual setup.\n*   **Architecture and Capabilities** GPT-5 is not a single model but a system that combines a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" or \"reasoning\" model for complex problems, with a real-time router that automatically selects the appropriate model based on the task. This unified architecture aims to eliminate the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n    *   **Multimodality** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text, images, and audio simultaneously, rather than relying on pre-trained language or vision models. It can process and generate content from text, code, and images in a single interaction.\n    *   **Reasoning and Accuracy** It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, building on advancements from previous \"o-series\" models (like o1 and o3). OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors. It reportedly has 45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4o with web search enabled and 80% fewer than OpenAI o3.\n    *   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task. It is designed for complex, multi-step workflows and can interact directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites through native integrations.\n    *   **Context Window** The model offers massive context windows, capable of holding around 256,000 tokens in memory for ChatGPT users and expanding to 400,000 through the API, which is crucial for multi-day projects and complex codebases.\n    *   **Coding Improvements** Developers benefit from advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, improved debugging, and \"vibe coding,\" which allows it to generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n*   **Variants** GPT-5 is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and balancing knowledge cutoff, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale.\n*   **Reception** Early benchmarks show GPT-5 outperforming humans on SimpleBench, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%. While its arrival has been met with excitement, there has also been some criticism from developers and users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that while GPT-5 performs better in most ways, the company underestimated how much users liked certain aspects of GPT-4o, and they are working on making GPT-5 \"feel warmer\"."
