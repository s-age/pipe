          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is publicly accessible through ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and the OpenAI API.\n\nGPT-5 builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advancements from reasoning-first models and unifying advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, enabling it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It employs a chain-of-thought process for complex queries, mapping out intermediate steps before providing a final answer.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and process and generate content from these data types in a single interaction.\n*   **Real-time Model Routing:** GPT-5 features a built-in routing system that dynamically decides whether to answer instantly or to engage in step-by-step reasoning based on the query's complexity. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions and provides more accurate answers, including in areas like health questions.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, debugging, and an expanded context window for larger projects. It also improves writing with better style, depth, and control over tone.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, and through the API, this expands to 400,000 tokens, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than hard refusals.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** The model includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources related to its task using a browser.\n\n**Variants of GPT-5:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system of models, including specialized variants optimized for different use cases. These include `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are offered, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. ChatGPT provides access to `gpt-5` with standard reasoning, and paid tiers offer increased usage limits and improved performance, including `GPT-5 Pro` for high-reasoning tasks.\n\n**Training:**\nGPT-5's training involved unsupervised pretraining on a large-scale multilingual dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Its visual and text capabilities were developed alongside each other during training.\n\n**Reception:**\nThe release of GPT-5 has been met with a mix of excitement and some criticism. While it has shown significant gains in logical reasoning, multi-step problem-solving, and memory retention, some users expressed frustration over the removal of legacy GPT models within ChatGPT for non-Pro users, leading to less control over model selection. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged this feedback and stated that an option to select GPT-4o would be brought back for Plus users."
