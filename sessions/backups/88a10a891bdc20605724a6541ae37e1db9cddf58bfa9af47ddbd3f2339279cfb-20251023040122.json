          "summary": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. This release marks the fifth generation in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4. GPT-5 is now publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 integrates advanced reasoning capabilities, combining elements from previous \"o-series\" models (like o1 and o3) with the GPT series. It operates as a system containing a fast, high-throughput model and a deeper reasoning model, with a real-time router that selects the appropriate model based on the complexity and type of the conversation. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Multimodality** The model is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on various modalities such as text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and generate content across these formats. Enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities are also part of its multimodal processing.\n*   **Improved Performance** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements in faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination levels compared to its predecessors. Early benchmarks suggest GPT-5 is the first model to outperform humans on SimpleBench, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources relevant to its tasks.\n*   **Expanded Context Window** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This significantly enhances its ability to understand and retain context over longer documents, meetings, and codebases.\n*   **Enhanced Safety** GPT-5 incorporates a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n*   **Availability and Variants** GPT-5 is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and balancing knowledge cutoff, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. For API users, these variants are priced per million input and output tokens. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all users, replacing GPT-4o.\n\nThe development of GPT-5 involved extensive \"red team\" testing to address safety and ethical concerns before its release. While its launch was met with excitement, some users expressed frustration over the initial removal of legacy GPT models in ChatGPT for non-Pro users, which OpenAI addressed by bringing back an option to select GPT-4o for Plus users."

          "summary": "GPT-5, OpenAI's fifth-generation generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation model, was officially launched on August 7, 2025. This multimodal large language model succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need for users to switch between specialized models. It was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors.\n\nNotable improvements and features include:\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** GPT-5 directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy. A real-time router within the system decides whether to provide an instant answer or engage in step-by-step reasoning based on the query's complexity.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** It can analyze and generate content from text, images, and audio in a single interaction, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucination:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers more accurate answers to health questions and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to earlier versions.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** The model demonstrates better coding and writing skills, offering more control over content tone and smarter code generation. Developers also benefit from an expanded context window for larger projects and API integrations for creating AI agents.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for task-related sources.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, the model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** It implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o entirely.\n\nThe GPT-5 system comprises several variants optimized for different use cases:\n*   **gpt-5-main and gpt-5-main-mini:** Fast, high-throughput models for routine queries.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-thinking-mini:** Deeper reasoning models.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-nano:** An even smaller and faster version of the thinking model accessible via the API.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-pro:** A version available in ChatGPT with a setting that utilizes parallel test-time compute.\n\nFor API users, GPT-5 is offered in variants like `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with pricing based on input and output tokens.\n\n**Background and Reception:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2025, and CEO Sam Altman confirmed its development in November 2024. Leading up to its release, there was significant anticipation, with reports of enterprise customers finding it \"materially better\" than GPT-4.\n\nUpon its release, GPT-5 was met with a mix of excitement and criticism. Some users expressed frustration that legacy GPT models were no longer available within ChatGPT for non-Pro users, feeling they had less control due to the GPT-5 router system. Altman acknowledged this feedback and stated that OpenAI would reintroduce an option to select GPT-4o for Plus users. He also mentioned that OpenAI is working on GPT-5's personality to make the model \"feel warmer,\" with an update rolled out on August 15, 2025."
