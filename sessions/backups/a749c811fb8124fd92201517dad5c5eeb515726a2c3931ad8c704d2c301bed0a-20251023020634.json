          "content": "GPT-5, OpenAI's fifth-generation generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation model, was officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advancements in reasoning and non-reasoning functionality under a unified interface.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified System:** GPT-5 is designed as a unified system that combines a fast, high-throughput model for routine tasks and a deeper reasoning model for complex problems. It includes a real-time router that automatically determines which model to use based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and has enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Reasoning and Accuracy:** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. OpenAI states that it significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions, with responses being 45% less likely to contain factual errors than GPT-4o with web search enabled.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** Improvements over its predecessors include better coding and writing skills, offering more control over the tone of content and smarter code generation.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, the model can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API.\n*   **Safety:** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusals to user prompts.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available in several variants:\n*   **gpt-5-main** and **gpt-5-main-mini:** Fast, high-throughput models.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking** and **gpt-5-thinking-mini:** Deeper reasoning models.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-nano:** An even smaller and faster version of the thinking model, accessible via the API.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-pro:** A version accessible via ChatGPT that utilizes parallel test-time compute.\n\nFor API users, GPT-5 is offered in variants such as `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with pricing based on input and output tokens. It is also the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot is now powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced features without additional cost.\n\n**Background:**\nOpenAI had filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2023, and CEO Sam Altman confirmed in November 2023 that the company was working on its development. Prior to its release, OpenAI rolled out GPT-4.5 (internally known as Orion) as a transitional model that improved reasoning accuracy and reduced hallucinations."
