          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This release marks a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\n**Key Features and Improvements:**\n\nGPT-5 is a multimodal large language model, capable of processing and generating content from text, code, and images in a single interaction. It unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models.\n\nNotable improvements and features include:\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning:** GPT-5 integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy. It has shown significant improvements in multi-step logical inference, scoring over 90% on advanced math competitions and over 85% on PhD-level science questions.\n*   **Unified Architecture and Routing:** The model operates as a unified adaptive system with a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. This eliminates the need for manual model switching.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** Integrated text, image, and voice understanding are available through a single interface, with video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance:** GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window, and improved debugging and code review. It scored 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for real-world Python coding tasks.\n*   **Enhanced Writing Skills:** The model provides better style and depth of writing, with more control over the tone of content.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Accuracy:** GPT-5 significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions and provides more accurate answers.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** It includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources related to its task using a browser.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries.\n\n**Accessibility and Variants:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is now the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o.\n\nOpenAI offers GPT-5 in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, each optimized for different use cases and balancing knowledge cut-off, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. For API users, these variants are priced per million input and output tokens. ChatGPT also provides access to `gpt-5-thinking` with a \"Pro\" setting for high-reasoning tasks."
