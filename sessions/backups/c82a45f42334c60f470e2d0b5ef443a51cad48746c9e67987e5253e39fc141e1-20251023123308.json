          "summary": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants. It was officially launched on August 7, 2025, during a livestream event.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 represents a significant leap in AI capabilities, integrating advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding into a unified system.\n\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained from scratch on various data types like text, images, and audio simultaneously, without relying on already-trained language or vision models. It can process and generate content from these different modalities in a single interaction.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** The model directly incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, which were previously found in OpenAI's \"o-series\" models (like o1 and o3). This allows it to handle complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance.\n*   **Adaptive System and Real-time Routing:** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system with a real-time router. This system automatically selects the most appropriate model for a given task, choosing between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination levels.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, the model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for both free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o entirely. In Microsoft Copilot, GPT-5 is available without extra cost or manual setup.\n\n**Variants:**\nThe GPT-5 system includes several variants optimized for different use cases: `gpt-5-main` and `gpt-5-main-mini` for fast, high-throughput tasks, and `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano` for deeper reasoning. Developers can access these through the OpenAI API, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. ChatGPT also provides access to `gpt-5-thinking` with a \"pro\" setting for parallel test-time compute."
