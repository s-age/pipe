          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's latest-generation large language model, officially released on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Multimodal and Unified Architecture:** GPT-5 is a natively multimodal model, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models.\n*   **Integrated Reasoning:** The model directly integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models. This allows it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Reasoning Routing System:** GPT-5 features a real-time router that dynamically decides which model to use based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent. This means simple queries receive fast responses, while complex tasks engage a deeper reasoning model.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements in faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and reduced hallucination levels compared to earlier models.\n*   **Enhanced Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This significantly improves its ability to understand and retain context across long documents, meetings, and codebases.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information related to its tasks.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is not a single model but a system comprising several variants optimized for different use cases:\n*   **gpt-5-main / gpt-5:** The flagship model designed for deep analysis and complex workflows.\n*   **gpt-5-main-mini / gpt-5-mini:** A faster, lower-cost option with solid reasoning for quick, well-defined tasks.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking / gpt-5-pro:** A deeper reasoning model for the most demanding analytical work, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-mini / gpt-5-thinking-nano:** Smaller and faster versions of the thinking model.\n*   **gpt-5-chat:** A variant designed for chat applications.\n\nGPT-5 is now the default model in ChatGPT for all users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced features without extra cost.\n\n**Development Background:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2023, and CEO Sam Altman confirmed the company was working on its development in November 2023. While an earlier internal model called \"Orion\" was intended to be GPT-5, it was released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025 after failing to produce a sufficiently better model. GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025."
