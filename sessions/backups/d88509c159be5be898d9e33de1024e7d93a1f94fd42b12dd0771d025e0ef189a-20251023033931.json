          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This multimodal model succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, such as GPT-4o, and represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 integrates advanced reasoning capabilities, previously found in models like o1 and o3, directly into its core. It operates as a unified adaptive system with a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, eliminating the need for manual model switching.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Accuracy** OpenAI has focused on significantly reducing hallucinations and factual errors, leading to more accurate responses.\n*   **Enhanced Multimodality** GPT-5 can natively understand and generate content from various data types, including text, images, and audio, in a single interaction.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance** The model offers significantly improved coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, better debugging, and an expanded context window for larger projects. It can generate deployable applications from natural language prompts, a feature dubbed \"Vibe Coding.\"\n*   **Advanced Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources using a browser to complete tasks.\n*   **Longer Context Window** It supports a combined input and output context length of up to 400,000 tokens, enabling it to retrieve information more accurately from large inputs.\n*   **Safety and Ethical Considerations** OpenAI has implemented a new \"safe completions\" method to reduce hallucinations and aims to provide safe, high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them.\n\nGPT-5 is accessible to users through ChatGPT (for both free and paid tiers), Microsoft Copilot, and the OpenAI API. For developers, it is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with pricing based on input and output tokens."
