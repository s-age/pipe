        "message": "Flask is a popular, lightweight, and versatile micro web framework for Python, designed to make getting started with web development quick and easy while allowing for scalability to complex applications. It is classified as a \"micro-framework\" because it provides the essentials for web development without imposing unnecessary complexity or requiring particular tools or libraries, giving developers significant control and flexibility over the application's structure.\n\nKey aspects of Flask include:\n*   **Core Components** Flask is built upon several powerful libraries:\n    *   **Werkzeug:** A comprehensive WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit that helps manage the application's request and response cycles.\n    *   **Jinja2:** A templating engine that enables the use of dynamic HTML in applications, making it easy to build web pages with variables and loops.\n    *   **MarkupSafe:** A string handling library.\n    *   **ItsDangerous:** A safe data serialization library.\n    *   **Click:** A Python package used for creating command-line interfaces (CLI).\n*   **Features** Flask offers a range of features, including a built-in development server and debugger, integrated support for unit testing, RESTful request dispatching, support for secure cookies (client-side sessions), 100% WSGI 1.0 compliance, Unicode-based functionality, and comprehensive documentation. It also supports extensions that can add functionalities like object-relational mappers (ORMs) and form validation.\n*   **History and Popularity** Created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts, Flask was initially conceived as an April Fool's joke before evolving into a serious application. Development later transitioned to the Pallets project. Flask has gained considerable popularity among Python developers, consistently being voted a top web framework in surveys.\n*   **Applications** Despite its lightweight nature, Flask is used to build robust applications across various domains. It is a popular choice for creating RESTful APIs, microservices, and backends for single-page applications (SPAs), and can be integrated with front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.\n*   **Basic Usage** Developers can define routes using decorators, handle HTTP requests and responses, manage user sessions, and incorporate HTML templates using Jinja2. Flask also provides mechanisms for managing static files (like CSS and JavaScript) and configuring application settings such as debug mode and database connections."
