          "summary": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in OpenAI's series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is publicly accessible through the chatbot products ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as the OpenAI API.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning:** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, previously seen in OpenAI's o-series models, to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Real-time Model Routing:** The system incorporates a real-time router that dynamically selects the most suitable model for a given task, balancing speed and complexity. This means simple queries receive fast responses, while complex tasks engage a deeper reasoning model.\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, and has enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance:** At its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. OpenAI reports improvements in faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate health-related answers, and reduced hallucination levels compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information related to its tasks.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** The model significantly expands its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing details.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations for limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Variants and Availability:**\nGPT-5 is not a single model but a system comprising several variants. These include `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are available, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. ChatGPT offers access to `gpt-5-thinking` and a \"Pro\" version, `gpt-5-thinking-pro`, which utilizes parallel test-time compute.\n\n**Development and Release:**\nOpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States on July 18, 2025. The model was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025. Prior to its release, OpenAI also launched GPT-OSS, a set of open-weight models with reasoning capabilities, on August 5, 2025."

          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This multimodal model is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformers and serves as a successor to GPT-4, integrating advancements from previous reasoning-first models like o1 and o3.\n\n**Key Features and Improvements of GPT-5:**\n*   **Unified Architecture** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need for users to switch between specialized models. It features a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning** The model incorporates deeper reasoning capabilities, including stepwise logic and chain-of-thought processes, making it adept at handling complex, multi-step workflows and sustained problem-solving.\n*   **Multimodality** GPT-5 can process and generate content from various data types simultaneously, including text, code, images, and voice, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Reduced Hallucinations and Improved Accuracy** OpenAI states that GPT-5 significantly reduces hallucinations and provides more accurate information compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance** It is touted as OpenAI's strongest coding model to date, demonstrating efficiency in code generation, debugging, and code review. It can generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts.\n*   **Advanced Safety** GPT-5 employs a \"safe completions\" method, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries for potentially harmful queries, rather than outright refusing them.\n*   **Longer Context Window** For API users, GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of up to 400,000 tokens, while ChatGPT Pro users benefit from a 128,000-token context window.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for information using a browser.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is now the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. It is also accessible to developers through the OpenAI API and is integrated into Microsoft Copilot. OpenAI offers several variants of GPT-5, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. Different ChatGPT tiers (Free, Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise) provide varying usage limits and access to advanced features and variants like GPT-5 Pro.\n\n**Performance:**\nEarly benchmarks indicate that GPT-5 outperforms humans on SimpleBench, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%. It also shows strong results in mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks."
