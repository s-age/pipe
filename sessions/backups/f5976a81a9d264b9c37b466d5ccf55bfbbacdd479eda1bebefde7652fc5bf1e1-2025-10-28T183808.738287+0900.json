        "message": "Flask is a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python, often referred to as a \"micro-framework\" because it provides the essentials for web development without imposing unnecessary complexity or a rigid structure. It was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts.\n\n**Key Features of Flask:**\n*   **Micro-framework Design:** Flask offers core tools like routing, templates, and request handling, allowing developers to choose and add other features as needed, providing greater control and flexibility over the application's structure.\n*   **Built on Werkzeug and Jinja2:** Flask is built upon the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which handles request and response cycles, and the Jinja2 templating engine, enabling dynamic HTML content.\n*   **Simple and Intuitive Routing:** It uses decorators to map URLs to Python functions, making it easy to define and control the flow of an application.\n*   **No Default ORM:** Unlike some other frameworks, Flask does not come with a built-in Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), giving developers the freedom to choose their preferred ORM (like SQLAlchemy) or use raw SQL.\n*   **RESTful API Support:** Flask is a popular choice for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for microservices and backends for single-page applications.\n*   **Built-in Development Server:** It includes a lightweight development server for easy local testing and debugging.\n*   **Extensibility:** Its modular design allows for easy extension of functionality through various community-provided extensions and libraries.\n\n**What Flask is Used For:**\nFlask is a versatile framework used for a wide range of applications, including:\n*   Building web applications, from small projects and prototypes to complex, scalable solutions.\n*   Developing RESTful APIs and microservices.\n*   Creating backends for single-page applications.\n*   Developing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for startups.\n*   Building online stores, banking applications, dashboards, and IoT projects.\n*   Integrating with machine learning applications to provide a web interface.\n\nMany well-known companies, such as Samsung, Pinterest, Airbnb, Netflix, Reddit, MIT, and Uber, utilize Flask for their web development needs."
