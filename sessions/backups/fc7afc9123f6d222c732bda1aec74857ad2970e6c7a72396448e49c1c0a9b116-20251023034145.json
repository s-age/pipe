          "summary": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and is a multimodal system, meaning it was trained on and can process various data types like text, images, and audio simultaneously.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models, to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Real-time Model Routing** The system incorporates a real-time router that dynamically allocates compute power, allowing it to decide whether to provide an instant answer for simple queries or engage in a deeper, chain-of-thought reasoning process for more complex tasks. This helps in producing higher-quality answers more quickly.\n*   **Improved Performance** GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, and finance. It offers faster response times, enhanced coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly reduced levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Expanded Context Window** The model has a significantly expanded context window, allowing it to retain and process a larger amount of information. In ChatGPT, it can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, and through the API, this expands to 400,000 tokens.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Multimodal Processing** Integrated text, image, and voice understanding are available through a single interface, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Enhanced Safety** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\nGPT-5 is available to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, each optimized for different use cases and balancing knowledge cutoff, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. The free tier of ChatGPT provides access to GPT-5 with standard reasoning capabilities, while Plus and Pro tiers offer increased usage limits and improved reasoning performance. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced AI experiences without extra cost."
