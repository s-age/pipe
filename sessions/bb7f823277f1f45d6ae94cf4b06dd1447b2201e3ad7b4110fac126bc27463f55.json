          "summary": "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth iteration in their series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, succeeding GPT-4 and its variants like GPT-4o and GPT-4.5.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\nGPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning capabilities with non-reasoning functionality under a single interface. At its release, it demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding.\n\nSignificant improvements over its predecessors include:\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Multimodality** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, having been trained from scratch on diverse data types such as text, images, and audio simultaneously. It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, which were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy.\n*   **Intelligent Routing System** The model incorporates a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate internal model based on the complexity, type, and user intent of a query. This system balances speed and analytical depth, utilizing fast, high-throughput models for routine tasks and deeper reasoning models for more intricate problems.\n*   **Improved Performance** Users can expect faster response times, superior coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health-related questions, and a significant reduction in hallucinations. For developers, it offers advanced coding features like smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents. It can even generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts, a feature dubbed \"Vibe Coding.\"\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, enabling it to perform tasks such as setting up its own desktop and autonomously searching for information using a browser.\n*   **Context Handling** The model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory within ChatGPT, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API.\n*   **Advanced Safety** OpenAI has implemented a \"Safe Completions\" approach in GPT-5, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than issuing hard refusals to user prompts.\n\n**Availability:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible through OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and via the OpenAI API for developers. It is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases. The free tier of ChatGPT now includes GPT-5 with standard reasoning capabilities.\n\n**Development Timeline:**\nWhile OpenAI CEO Sam Altman initially stated in April 2023 that GPT-5 was not actively being trained, focusing instead on GPT-4 development, the company later confirmed its development. An internal model codenamed \"Orion\" was intended to become GPT-5 but was eventually released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025 after failing to meet expectations for the next major iteration. However, by late July 2025, the release of GPT-5 in early August was widely anticipated, culminating in its official launch on August 7, 2025."
