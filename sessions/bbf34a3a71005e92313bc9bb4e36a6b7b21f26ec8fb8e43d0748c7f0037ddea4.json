          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\nGPT-5 is a multimodal large language model, meaning it was trained from scratch on multiple modalities like text and images simultaneously, unlike its predecessors. It integrates advanced reasoning capabilities that were previously found in OpenAI's o-series models, such as o1 and o3.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified System and Real-time Routing** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system with a real-time router that automatically selects the most suitable model for a given task. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models for different complexities, offering fast, high-throughput responses for routine queries and deeper reasoning for complex tasks.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Accuracy** The model boasts state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. It significantly reduces hallucinations and provides more accurate answers compared to earlier versions.\n*   **Multimodal Processing** GPT-5 offers integrated text, image, and voice understanding through a single interface, with added video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Improved Coding and Writing** Developers benefit from smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents. The model also provides better style and depth in writing, with more control over tone.\n*   **Massive Context Windows** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, and through the API, this expands to 400,000, allowing it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Advanced Safety** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering clear explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\nGPT-5 is available to users of ChatGPT (including free, Plus, and Pro tiers) and Microsoft Copilot. For developers, it is accessible through the OpenAI API and comes in several variants: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases."
