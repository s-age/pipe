          "summary": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth generation of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It is a multimodal large language model that builds upon the GPT architecture, integrating advancements from previous reasoning-first models.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified System:** GPT-5 unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models. It combines a fast, high-throughput model, a deeper reasoning model, and a real-time router that selects the appropriate model based on the conversation's complexity and user intent.\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It can analyze text, images, and audio, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Reasoning and Accuracy:** The model integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, allowing it to solve complex, multi-step challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. It significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions and provides more accurate answers to health questions.\n*   **Enhanced Coding and Writing:** GPT-5 offers improved coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, debugging, and an expanded context window for larger projects. It also provides better writing skills with more control over tone and depth.\n*   **Context Handling:** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, enabling it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for task-related sources.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** The model implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing helpful responses within safety boundaries and offering nuanced explanations of limitations rather than outright refusals.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is not a single model but a system of models, with several variants optimized for different use cases:\n*   **gpt-5:** The flagship model, designed for deep analysis and complex workflows.\n*   **gpt-5-mini:** A faster, lower-cost option with solid reasoning capabilities for quick, well-defined tasks.\n*   **gpt-5-nano:** An even smaller and faster version of the thinking model, accessible via the API.\n*   **gpt-5-chat:** A variant designed for chat applications.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-thinking-mini:** Deeper reasoning models within the GPT-5 system.\n*   **gpt-5-thinking-pro:** A version accessible via ChatGPT with a setting that utilizes parallel test-time compute.\n\nGPT-5 became the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. Microsoft Copilot is also powered by GPT-5, offering enhanced features without extra cost.\n\n**Training:**\nGPT-5's training involved three stages: unsupervised pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. It was trained on a large-scale multilingual dataset including books, articles, web pages, academic papers, and licensed sources. Unlike GPT-4, GPT-5's visual and text capabilities were developed alongside each other throughout training."
