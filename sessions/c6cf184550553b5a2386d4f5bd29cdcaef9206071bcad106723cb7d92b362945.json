          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's latest-generation large language model, officially released on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth in their series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n*   **Unified Architecture and Multimodality** GPT-5 is a natively multimodal model, meaning it was trained from scratch on various modalities like text and images simultaneously. It unifies advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system, eliminating the need to switch between specialized models.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Problem Solving** The model features a real-time router that decides whether to provide an instant answer or engage in deeper, multi-step reasoning based on the complexity of the task. This allows for adaptive reasoning. It has shown state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including outperforming humans on SimpleBench with a 90% score.\n*   **Improved Performance** GPT-5 offers faster response times, better coding and writing skills, and more accurate answers to health questions. It significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions. On coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, GPT-5 scored 74.9%, a notable improvement over previous models.\n*   **Context Handling** In ChatGPT, GPT-5 can hold approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 tokens through the API. This allows it to process entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing context.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information related to its tasks. It also features native integrations for interacting directly with external tools, CRMs, databases, and productivity suites.\n*   **Safety and User Experience** OpenAI has implemented \"safe completions\" in GPT-5, aiming to provide safe, high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them. It also offers more nuanced and informative responses that outline any limitations to prompts.\n*   **Accessibility** GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o.\n\n**Variants of GPT-5:**\nGPT-5 is a family of models, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`. For API users, variants like `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` are available. ChatGPT provides access to `gpt-5-thinking` and `gpt-5-thinking-pro` for enhanced reasoning.\n\n**Development Background:**\nWhile OpenAI CEO Sam Altman initially stated in April 2023 that GPT-5 was not being trained, the company filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in July 2023, and Altman confirmed its development in November 2023. An earlier internal model, \"Orion,\" intended to be GPT-5, was instead released as GPT-4.5 in February 2025. GPT-5 was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025."
