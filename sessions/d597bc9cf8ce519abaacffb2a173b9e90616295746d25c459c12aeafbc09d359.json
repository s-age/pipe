          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This release marks a significant advancement in AI, unifying advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n\n*   **Unified Architecture and Real-time Routing:** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models for different tasks. A real-time router automatically selects the most appropriate model—either a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries or a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning—based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Reduced Hallucinations:** The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, and finance. Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly lower levels of hallucination. For complex queries, GPT-5 employs a chain-of-thought process with embedded prompt-chaining, mapping out intermediate steps before providing a final answer.\n*   **Multimodality:** GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model, capable of processing and generating content from text, code, and images in a single interaction.\n*   **Improved Coding Performance:** On benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, GPT-5 scores 74.9%, a notable increase from previous models. It also shows significant gains in multi-language code editing and can generate full, deployable applications from natural language prompts, a feature dubbed \"Vibe Coding\".\n*   **Massive Context Windows:** The API version of GPT-5 supports a combined input and output context length of 400,000 tokens, allowing it to retrieve information more accurately from large inputs. The Pro Tier offers an even larger context window of 128,000 tokens.\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** GPT-5 introduces \"safe completions,\" aiming to provide nuanced and informative responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them. It also offers fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information and provides more critical, less effusively agreeable answers.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use its browser to search for sources related to its task.\n\n**Availability and Variants:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and offering varying balances of knowledge cut-off, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale.\n\n**Integration with Products:**\n\nGPT-5 is now the default model in ChatGPT for all free and paid users, replacing GPT-4o. It is also integrated into Microsoft Copilot, providing smarter, safer, and more personalized AI experiences without extra cost or manual setup.\n\n**Development and Release Timeline:**\n\nWhile there were earlier speculations and some delays, with an internal model codenamed \"Orion\" initially intended to be GPT-5 but released as GPT-4.5, OpenAI officially unveiled GPT-5 during a livestream event on August 7, 2025. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, had previously hinted at its potential, describing it as \"smarter\" with enhanced reasoning and reliability."
