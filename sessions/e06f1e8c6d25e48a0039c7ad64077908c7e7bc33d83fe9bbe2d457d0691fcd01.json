          "content": "OpenAI officially launched GPT-5, its latest multimodal large language model, on August 7, 2025. It is the fifth iteration in the series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models and succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o.\n\nKey features and capabilities of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning** GPT-5 integrates advanced reasoning capabilities, previously found in OpenAI's \"o-series\" models, into a single system. It features a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, eliminating the need for manual switching.\n*   **Multimodality** The model is natively multimodal, trained from scratch on various modalities like text, images, and audio simultaneously. It offers integrated text, image, and voice understanding through a single interface, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Performance** OpenAI states that GPT-5 delivers state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Improvements over its predecessors include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and significantly reduced hallucination levels.\n*   **Enhanced Context Handling** GPT-5 dramatically expands its ability to understand and retain context, capable of processing entire documents, multi-hour meetings, and large codebases without losing track of details. In ChatGPT, it can hold around 256,000 tokens in memory, expanding to 400,000 through the API.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** The model includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for sources related to its task.\n*   **Advanced Safety** GPT-5 implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries. It is designed to be more accurate and less prone to factual errors than previous models.\n*   **Availability** GPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. It is available across various ChatGPT tiers, including free, Plus, and Pro, with different variants like `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` optimized for different use cases.\n\nWhile there were earlier speculations about delays, with some industry experts anticipating a late 2025 release, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5 during a livestream event on August 7, 2025."
