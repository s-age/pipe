          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's latest-generation large language model, officially released on August 7, 2025. It succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and is designed to unify advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Unified Adaptive System:** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system with a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, eliminating the need for manual switching between specialized models.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning:** It integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, building on advancements from previous reasoning-first models like o1 and o3. This allows it to handle complex, multi-step workflows and sustained problem-solving with greater accuracy.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model that can analyze and generate content from text, images, and audio, with enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI has focused on significantly reducing hallucinations and factual errors compared to earlier versions.\n*   **Superior Coding Performance:** GPT-5 offers significantly improved coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, debugging, and multi-step workflow execution, with better efficiency in token usage and tool calls.\n*   **Expanded Context Window:** The model supports a substantial context length, with around 256,000 tokens in memory for ChatGPT and up to 400,000 tokens through the API, allowing it to process entire documents, long meetings, and large codebases.\n*   **Enhanced Writing and Language Support:** GPT-5 improves on prior models with better style and depth of writing, offering more control over tone, and brings a major leap in multilingual and voice capabilities.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** It implements a \"Safe Completions\" approach, providing nuanced and informative responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries.\n*   **AI Agent Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and use its browser to search autonomously for sources related to its task.\n\n**Variants and Availability:**\nGPT-5 is available in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, and `gpt-5-chat`, each optimized for different use cases and balancing knowledge cut-off, reasoning depth, speed, and operational scale. It is accessible to users of ChatGPT (free and paid tiers) and Microsoft Copilot, as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n\n**Performance:**\nAt its release, GPT-5 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. Early benchmarks showed it outperforming humans on SimpleBench, scoring 90% against an average human score of 83%.\n\n**Controversy:**\nOpenAI researchers faced criticism for initially claiming GPT-5 had solved previously unsolved math problems, which were later clarified to be known results unfamiliar to the operator of the website where the problems were listed. Mathematicians noted that AI models like GPT-5 are currently most helpful for speeding up basic research tasks like literature review rather than independently solving complex mathematical problems."
