          "content": "OpenAI officially released GPT-5, its latest-generation large language model, on August 7, 2025. This multimodal model, the fifth in the GPT series, succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and is designed to unify advanced reasoning, multimodal input, and task execution into a single system.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities of GPT-5:**\n\n*   **Unified Architecture and Reasoning Routing:** GPT-5 operates as a unified adaptive system, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between specialized models for different tasks. It features a real-time router that automatically selects between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a \"thinking\" model for complex reasoning, based on the conversation type, complexity, and user intent.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning:** The model integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, building on advancements from previous reasoning-first models like o1 and o3. It demonstrates significant improvements in multi-step logical inference, scoring over 90% on advanced math competitions and over 85% on PhD-level science questions.\n*   **Multimodal Processing:** GPT-5 can handle multiple data types simultaneously, processing and generating content from text, code, and images in a single interaction. It also includes video frame analysis capabilities and enhanced visual reasoning.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** OpenAI states that GPT-5 offers more accurate answers to health questions and significantly lower levels of hallucination compared to its predecessors.\n*   **Superior Coding and Writing Skills:** The model shows better coding and writing skills, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and improved control over writing tone and depth. On benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, GPT-5 scores 74.9%, a notable improvement over previous models.\n*   **Agentic Functionality:** GPT-5 includes agentic functionality, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously search for sources related to its task using its browser.\n*   **Advanced Safety:** OpenAI has implemented a \"safe completions\" approach, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright declining potentially harmful queries.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and to developers through the OpenAI API. For API users, GPT-5 is offered in several variants, including `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, with adjustable reasoning effort and verbosity. It is also available across multiple ChatGPT tiers, including free and paid plans.\n\n**Development and Release:**\n\nWhile initial expectations for GPT-5's launch were earlier, the release was delayed due to technical and logistical challenges, with OpenAI focusing on refining existing models and exploring reasoning-based AI. OpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in July 2025, and the model was unveiled during a livestream event on August 7, 2025."
