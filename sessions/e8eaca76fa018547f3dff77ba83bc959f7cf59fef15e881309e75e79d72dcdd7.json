          "content": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's fifth-generation multimodal large language model, officially launched on August 7, 2025. It succeeds GPT-4 and its variants, including GPT-4o, and represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities.\n\nKey features and improvements of GPT-5 include:\n*   **Unified System and Real-time Routing** GPT-5 operates as a unified system that combines reasoning and non-reasoning functionalities under a single interface. It features a real-time router that automatically selects the most appropriate model for a given task, choosing between a fast, high-throughput model for routine queries and a deeper reasoning model for complex problems. This eliminates the need for users to manually switch between specialized models.\n*   **Native Multimodality** Unlike its predecessors, GPT-5 was trained from scratch on multiple modalities simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This allows it to process and generate content across these different data types, offering enhanced visual reasoning and video frame analysis capabilities.\n*   **Enhanced Reasoning and Accuracy** The model integrates deeper reasoning capabilities, enabling it to solve multi-step and complex challenges with greater accuracy and nuance. OpenAI reports that GPT-5 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to earlier versions.\n*   **Improved Coding and Writing** GPT-5 offers advanced coding capabilities, including smarter code generation, an expanded context window for larger projects, and API integrations for creating AI agents. Its writing skills are also enhanced, providing better style, depth, and more control over the tone of content.\n*   **Advanced Safety Features** OpenAI has implemented a \"Safe Completions\" approach in GPT-5, aiming to provide helpful responses within safety boundaries rather than outright refusing potentially harmful queries. The model is also designed to give more critical and \"less effusively agreeable\" answers.\n*   **Agentic Functionality** GPT-5 includes agentic capabilities, allowing it to set up its own desktop and autonomously use a browser to search for information relevant to its tasks.\n*   **Expanded Context Window** In ChatGPT, the model can retain approximately 256,000 tokens in memory, which expands to 400,000 tokens through the API, enabling it to handle larger documents and longer conversations.\n\nGPT-5 is publicly accessible to users of OpenAI's chatbot products like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and it is also available to developers through the OpenAI API. It is rolling out to all ChatGPT users, including those on the free tier, with increased usage limits and improved reasoning performance for Plus and Pro subscribers. The GPT-5 system includes various models such as `gpt-5-main`, `gpt-5-main-mini`, and deeper reasoning models like `gpt-5-thinking`, `gpt-5-thinking-mini`, and `gpt-5-thinking-nano`."
